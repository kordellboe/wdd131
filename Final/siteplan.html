    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to be a simple web version of my Ovaxon app.
      Users will be able to look up a movie and see where it is currently
      streaming based on data stored with the TMDB database.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      The audience is movie fans who have one or more streaming services and
      want a quick way to check where they can watch a specific movie without
      jumping between different apps.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
    <p>
      Dynamic behavior will be handled with JavaScript:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Store a list of movies as an array of objects. Each movie will include
        title, year, genre, and a list of streaming services.
      </li>
      <li>
        A search bar that filters the movie list by title as the user types.
      </li>
      <li>
        A streaming service filter that shows only movies available on the
        selected service.
      </li>
      <li>
        A button that picks a random movie from the list and shows it as a
        suggestion to watch.
      </li>
    </ul>
